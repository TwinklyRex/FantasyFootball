# Introduction

I'm going to investigate if there is a linear relationship between *speed* and _distance_ of the **cars** dataset. First of all, let's examine our dataset (display first 6 rows):

```{r echo=FALSE}
head(cars)
```

this is the whole dataset:

```{r echo=FALSE}
cars
```

# Exploratory Data Analytics

Let's investigate the size and dimensionality of our __cars__ dataset:

```{r echo=FALSE}
n_rows <- nrow(cars)
n_cols <- ncol(cars)

# n_rows
# n_cols
```
The number of rows is: `r n_rows`, whereas the number of columns is `r n_cols`.

## Linear Relationship Investigation (Plots)
Let's plot the variables to see if there is any kind of linear relationship present

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

GGplot variant:

```{r}
cars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=speed, y=dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()
```

## Linear Relationship Investigation (Summary Stats)

let's investigate correlation:

```{r}
cor_speed_dist <- cor(cars$speed, cars$dist)
cor_speed_dist <- round(cor_speed_dist, 2)
cor_speed_dist
```

the same thing using tidyverse:
```{r}
cor_speed_dist_tidyv <- cor(cars$speed, cars$dist)

cor_speed_dist_tidyv %>% 
  round(2)
```

```{r}
cars %>% 
  filter(
    between(speed, 4, 10)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    speed_sq = speed^2,
    dist_sqrt = round(sqrt(dist), 2)
  )
```

# LaTeX code

you can add some text and inline math expression $\frac{a+b}{c+d}$ which is really really cool!

math code centered $$\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} \exp(-x) = 0$$ which is again really really cool!
